The aim of the exercise is to create a model for the housing prices in California, from a dataset of Kaggle from 1990. To create this model, I have first visualized and cleaned the data, and then used different machine learning models such as:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Regressor

The exercise is done in the book Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow, in the Second Chapter.
